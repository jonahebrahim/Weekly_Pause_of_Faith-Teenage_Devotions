    <h3>Month’s Theme: You Are Called Now</h3>
    <p>God’s not waiting for you to grow up or be perfect. He’s calling you to live with purpose and faith right now — in school, with friends, and in your heart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section theme" style="background-color:#4a84b3;">
    <h3>This Week’s Focus: God Can Use You Even When You Feel Small</h3>
    <p>You might feel too young or not ready, but God can do big things through small people who trust Him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Monthly Memory Verse</h3>
    <div class="verse-box memory-verse">
      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>
      — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
    </div>
    <p>God, please help us remember Your word,<br>to trust Your plans, and to hold onto hope every day.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>This Week’s Bible Passage</h3>
    <div class="verse-box">
      “David said to Saul, ‘Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.’”<br>
      — 1 Samuel 17:32 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Devotion</h3>
    <p>Have you ever felt too small to make a difference? Maybe you’ve thought, <em>“I’m too young,”</em> or <em>“I don’t know enough,”</em> or even <em>“No one will listen to me.”</em> Guess what? You’re not alone. Even the heroes in the Bible felt that way sometimes — but God still used them in amazing ways.</p>

    <p>David was just a young shepherd boy when he showed up at the battlefield. Everyone else saw a giant (literally), but David saw something different: an opportunity to trust God. He wasn’t the strongest, or the tallest, or the most experienced warrior — but he <strong>was</strong> willing.</p>

    <p>David had confidence not in himself, but in God. He remembered how God had helped him before — with lions and bears — and he believed God would help him again. He stepped forward when everyone else was too afraid.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, God calls you to do something that feels way too big — like standing up for someone, speaking truth when it’s hard, or showing kindness when no one else is. You might feel small, but God is with you. And when He’s with you, <strong>small</strong> is more than enough.</p>

    <p>You don’t need to be perfect or powerful to make a difference. You just need to trust that God is big enough to use someone like you. And He is.</p>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>Reflective Question</h3>
    <p>What’s one way you can step out in faith this week, even if you feel small or unsure?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>What Word or Phrase Stands Out to You?</h3>
    <p>Take a moment to notice if any part of the memory verse or this week’s Bible passage speaks most clearly to you. Write it down or remember it.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Memory Verse Reminder</h3>

      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>

    <h3>Prayer</h3>
    <p>God, even when I feel small, help me remember that You are big and that You can use me. I want to trust You and step out in faith. Amen.</p>
