      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>

    <h3>This Week’s Bible Passage</h3>
    <div class="verse-box">
      “The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;<br>
      he delivers them from all their troubles.<br>
      The Lord is close to the brokenhearted<br>
      and saves those who are crushed in spirit.<br>
      The righteous person may have many troubles,<br>
      but the Lord delivers him from them all;<br>
      he protects all his bones,<br>
      not one of them will be broken.”<br>
      — Psalm 34:17–20 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Devotion</h3>
    <p>This week’s passage reminds us that being a follower of God doesn’t mean life will be easy or free from troubles. In fact, the Bible is honest about the hard times we face — loneliness, sadness, confusion, or even feeling brokenhearted. But what it also promises is something powerful: God is close to us in those moments.</p>

    <p>When you cry out in pain or frustration, God hears you. He isn’t distant or unaware; He is right there beside you, ready to comfort and protect. Even when you feel crushed in spirit, He wants to lift you up and carry your burdens.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it can be hard to believe that God truly understands what you’re going through, especially when things seem unfair or too difficult. But remember, the Lord knows every part of your story — every joy, every struggle, every silent prayer.</p>

    <p>You might not feel His presence all the time, and that’s okay. Faith isn’t about always feeling close to God; it’s about trusting His promises even when feelings don’t match.</p>

    <p>This week, try to hold onto this truth: God protects you. Not one part of your life is overlooked or ignored by Him. He cares deeply about you and is working in your life, even through hard times.</p>

    <p>Let this passage be a reminder that you are never alone. God’s love surrounds you, and He will give you strength to keep going. When you feel overwhelmed, remember to turn to Him and cry out — because He hears you.</p>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>Reflective Question</h3>
    <p>What is one struggle or worry you want to bring to God this week? How can knowing He is close change the way you feel about it?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>What Word or Phrase Stands Out to You?</h3>
    <p>Take a moment to notice if any part of the memory verse or this week’s Bible passage speaks most clearly to you. Write it down or remember it.</p>
