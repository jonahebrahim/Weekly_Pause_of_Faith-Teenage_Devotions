    <h2>Devotion for the Week of 1st June 2025</h2>

    <p><strong>Memory Verse for the Month:</strong> Psalm 119:11</p>
    <blockquote>"I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."</blockquote>

    <h3>Verse of the Day</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Psalm 27:1-4 (NIV)<br>
      "The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall. Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident. One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple."
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Devotion:</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to this week's devotion. As we begin the month of June, we remember that God's word is our guiding light. This verse from Psalm 27 reminds us that even when we face challenges, fear has no power over us because God is our refuge. His love and protection are stronger than any enemy. Let this devotion be a reminder that we can have confidence, knowing God is always by our side.</p>

    <p>God’s word also calls us to seek Him, not just in times of difficulty, but all the days of our life. As we journey through this week, let us remember to turn to Him first, seeking His presence in every moment. No matter what you face today, you are not alone—God is with you, guiding you and protecting you.</p>

    <p>Think about this verse, and what stands out to you today. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, but God’s word gives us peace that surpasses all understanding. Let’s make this a week where we intentionally seek God in our hearts and minds.</p>
