  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Devotion for the Week of 29th June 2025</h2>

  <div class="section theme">
    <h3>Month’s Theme: You Are Called Now</h3>
    <p>God’s not waiting for you to grow up or be perfect. He’s calling you to live with purpose and faith right now — in school, with friends, and in your heart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section theme" style="background-color:#4a84b3;">
    <h3>This Week’s Focus: You Were Made for Light</h3>
    <p>Even when the world feels dark, God created you to shine His light. Don’t hide it — let it shine.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Monthly Memory Verse</h3>
    <div class="verse-box memory-verse">
      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>
      — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
    </div>
    <p>God, please help us remember Your word,<br>to trust Your plans, and to hold onto hope every day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>This Week’s Bible Passage</h3>
    <div class="verse-box">
      “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.<br>
      Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand,<br>
      and it gives light to everyone in the house.<br>
      In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”<br>
      — Matthew 5:14–16 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Devotion</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, we try to blend in, to not be noticed. But Jesus says something different: you are light. Not “you might be” or “you could be”—you are.</p>

    <p>Light stands out in darkness. That can feel awkward or uncomfortable, especially if others around you don’t follow Jesus. But you weren’t made to hide. God created you to reflect His love, truth, and joy wherever you go.</p>

    <p>When you show kindness, choose honesty, include someone who’s left out, or even just stand up for what’s right — that’s light. People notice, even if they don’t say anything.</p>

    <p>This week, don’t be afraid to be different. That’s what light does. You might not feel like your life shines, but when you follow Jesus with your actions, your light matters. And it might help someone else find their way, too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>Reflective Question</h3>
    <p>Where is God asking you to shine your light this week? Who around you might need to see His love through your actions?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>What Word or Phrase Stands Out to You?</h3>
    <p>Think about the verse. Maybe “let your light shine” or “cannot be hidden” sticks with you. Keep that phrase in your heart this week.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Memory Verse Reminder</h3>
    <div class="verse-box memory-verse">
      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>
      — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section prayer">
    <h3>Prayer</h3>
    <p>God, thank You for making me a light. Help me to shine brightly, even when it feels hard or scary. Show me where and how You want me to reflect You this week. Amen.</p>
