  <div class="section theme">
    <h3>Month’s Theme: You Are Called Now</h3>
    <p>God’s not waiting for you to grow up or be perfect. He’s calling you to live with purpose and faith right now — in school, with friends, and in your heart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section theme" style="background-color:#4a84b3;">
    <h3>This Week’s Focus: God Works Through Your Everyday Faithfulness</h3>
    <p>It’s not about being famous or powerful. God loves to use your small acts of faith every day — right where you are.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Monthly Memory Verse</h3>
    <div class="verse-box memory-verse">
      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>
      — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
    </div>
    <p>God, please help us remember Your word,<br>to trust Your plans, and to hold onto hope every day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>This Week’s Bible Passage</h3>
    <div class="verse-box">
      “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much...”<br>
      — Luke 16:10 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Devotion</h3>
    <p>Have you ever felt like the things you do don’t matter much? Like praying alone, doing chores, or helping a friend quietly isn’t important enough? Jesus tells us something really cool — if you can be trusted with little things, you can be trusted with big things too.</p>

    <p>That means the way you live every single day — when no one is watching — is actually a big deal. God sees the small choices you make: choosing kindness, being honest, standing up for what’s right, even when it’s hard. These little choices show that your heart is faithful.</p>

    <p>And when God sees that kind of heart, He loves to use it. He doesn’t wait for you to be the best speaker or the leader of a crowd. He uses you *right now*, just as you are — especially when you stay faithful in the little things.</p>

    <p>So don’t underestimate your small moments. A quiet prayer, a kind word, or even finishing your homework with integrity — it all matters to God. These are the seeds of faithfulness He will grow into something amazing.</p>

    <p>This week, let’s ask God to help us be trustworthy in the small stuff. Because with Him, nothing done in love is ever wasted.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>Reflective Question</h3>
    <p>What’s one small thing you can do today with love and faith? How might God use it in a bigger way?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section question-box">
    <h3>What Word or Phrase Stands Out to You?</h3>
    <p>Take a moment to notice if any part of the memory verse or this week’s Bible passage speaks most clearly to you. Write it down or remember it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Memory Verse Reminder</h3>
    <div class="verse-box memory-verse">
      “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,<br>
      “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”<br>
      — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section prayer">
    <h3>Prayer</h3>
    <p>God, thank You for seeing the small things I do. Help me to be faithful in them. Teach me to trust You even when no one else sees. Use my everyday faith to do something great. Amen.</p>
